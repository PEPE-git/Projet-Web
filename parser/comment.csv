2105,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant proteins. They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys and 1-Cys peroxiredoxins (1). The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centered around a redox-active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine. All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common, in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid). The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three peroxiredoxin classes. For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving' cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several cell-specific thiol-containing reductants (R'-SH) (e.g. thioredoxin, AhpF, tryparedoxin or AhpD), completing the catalytic cycle. In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction forms an intrachain disulfide bond (1). To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to use thioredoxin as an electron donor (3). The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so that its oxidized form is directly reduced to cysteine by the reductant molecule (4).",1186

11945,"This enzyme, which forms part of the aerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, is a type I chelatase, being heterotrimeric and ATP-dependent. It comprises two components, one of which corresponds to CobN and the other is composed of two polypeptides, specified by cobS and cobT in Pseudomonas denitrificans, and named CobST (1). Hydrogenobyrinic acid is a very poor substrate. ATP can be replaced by dATP or CTP but the reaction proceeds more slowly. CobN exhibits a high affinity for hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. The oligomeric protein CobST possesses at least one sulfhydryl group that is essential for ATP-binding. Once the Co(2+) is inserted, the next step in the pathway ensures that the cobalt is ligated securely by reducing Co(II) to Co(I). This step is carried out by EC 1.16.8.1, cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase.",6469
