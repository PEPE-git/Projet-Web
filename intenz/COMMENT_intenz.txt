<comment>This enzyme is found primarily as a Zn(2+)-dependent form in archaea but a Ni(2+)-dependent form has been found in Gram-positive bacteria (7).

It is the enantiomer of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, the form of glycerophosphate found in bacteria and eukaryotes. The other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polar lipids in archaea are EC 2.5.1.41 (phosphoglycerol geranylgeranyltransferase) and EC 2.5.1.42 (geranylgeranylglycerol-phosphate geranylgeranyltransferase), which together alkylate the hydroxy groups of glycerol 1-phosphate to give unsaturated archaetidic acid, which is acted upon by EC 2.7.7.67 (CDP-archaeol synthase) to form CDP-unsaturated archaeol. The final step in the pathway involves the addition of L-serine, with concomitant removal of CMP, leading to the production of unsaturated archaetidylserine (5). Activity of the enzyme is stimulated by K(+) (2).</comment>	<comment>Responsible for the formation of archaea-specific sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, the first step in the biosynthesis of polar lipids in archaea.

<comment>This enzyme is present in some but not all Rhizobium species and belongs in the GFO/IDH/MocA protein family (2). This enzyme differs from hepatic 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase, which yields 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol as the product (see EC 1.1.1.263). In Sinorhizobium morelense, the product of the reaction, 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol, can be further metabolized to D-mannose (1). The enzyme also reduces 1,5-anhydro-D-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose and 2-ketoaldoses (called osones), such as D-glucosone (D-arabino-hexos-2-ulose) and 6-deoxy-D-glucosone. It does not reduce common aldoses and ketoses, or non-sugar aldehydes and ketones (1).</comment>	<comment>Present in some but not all Rhizobium species.

<comment>This enzyme carries out the first step in the conversion of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. It is involved in chlorophyll degradation, which occurs during leaf senescence (3,4) and it also forms part of the chlorophyll cycle, which interconverts chlorophyll a and b in response to changing light conditions (5,6). While both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plants, only breakdown products derived from chlorophyll a are found in the end products, i.e. non-fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs). The transition from chlorophyll b, which contains a formyl group on C7, to chlorophyll a, which contains a methyl group on C7, proceeds through the intermediate 7(1)-hydroxychlorophyll (1). Another enzyme, which requires ferredoxin but has not been characterized fully, is required to complete the conversion (3).</comment>	<comment>Carries out the first step in the conversion of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a.

Like in all other quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases the catalytic domain has an 8-bladed 'propeller' structure. It occurs in a wide range of bacteria. Catalyzes a direct oxidation of the pyranose form of D-glucose to the lactone and thence to D-gluconate in the periplasm. Oxidizes other monosaccharides including the pyranose forms of pentoses.</comment>	<comment>Formerly EC 1.1.99.17.</comment>
<comment>This flavin-dependent dehydrogenase is an essential membrane enzyme, functioning at the central junction of glycolysis, respiration and phospholipid biosynthesis. In bacteria, the enzyme is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane (6), while in eukaryotes it is tightly bound to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (2). In eukaryotes, this enzyme, together with the cytosolic enzyme EC 1.1.1.8, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)), forms the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle by which NADH produced in the cytosol, primarily from glycolysis, can be reoxidized to NAD(+) by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain (3). This shuttle plays a critical role in transferring reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH into the mitochondrial matrix (7,8). Insect flight muscle uses only CoQ(10) as the physiological quinone whereas hamster and rat mitochondria use mainly CoQ(9) (4). The enzyme is activated by calcium (3).</comment>	<comment>An essential membrane enzyme, functioning at the central junction of glycolysis, respiration and phospholipid biosynthesis.

<comment>Only described in acetic acid bacteria where it is involved in acetic acid production. Associated with membrane. Electron acceptor is membrane ubiquinone. A model structure suggests that, like all other quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases, the catalytic subunit has an 8-bladed 'propeller' structure, a calcium ion bound to the PQQ in the active site and an unusual disulfide ring structure in close proximity to the PQQ; the catalytic subunit also has a heme c in the C-terminal domain. The enzyme has two additional subunits, one of which contains three molecules of heme c. It does not require amines for activation. It has a restricted substrate specificity, oxidizing a few primary alcohols (C2 to C6), but not methanol, secondary alcohols and some aldehydes. It is assayed with phenazine methosulfate or with ferricyanide.</comment>

<comment>This enzyme is a member of the FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy-acid oxidase/dehydrogenase family (1). While all enzymes of this family oxidize the (S)-enantiomer of an alpha-hydroxy acid to an alpha-oxo acid, the ultimate oxidant (oxygen, intramolecular heme or some other acceptor) depends on the particular enzyme. This enzyme transfers the electron pair from FMNH(2) to a component of the electron transport chain, most probably ubiquinone (1,2). It is part of a metabolic pathway in Pseudomonads that allows these organisms to utilize mandelic acid, derivatized from the common soil metabolite amygdalin, as the sole source of carbon and energy (2). The enzyme has a large active-site pocket and preferentially binds substrates with longer sidechains, e.g. 2-hydroxyoctanoate rather than 2-hydroxybutyrate (1). It also prefers substrates that, like (S)-mandelate, have beta unsaturation, e.g. (indol-3-yl)glycolate compared with (indol-3-yl)lactate (1). Esters of mandelate, such as methyl (S)-mandelate, are also substrates (3).</comment>	<comment>While all enzymes of this family oxidize the (S)-enantiomer of an alpha-hydroxy acid to an alpha-oxo acid, the ultimate oxidant (oxygen, intramolecular heme or some other acceptor) depends on the particular enzyme.

<comment>This enzyme forms part of the pathway for the biosynthesis of 5-aminolevulinate from glutamate, known as the C(5) pathway, which is used in most eubacteria, and in all archaebacteria, algae and plants. However, in the alpha-proteobacteria, EC 2.3.1.37, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, is used in an alternative route to produce the product 5-aminolevulinate from succinyl-CoA and glycine. This route is found in the mitochondria of fungi and animals, organelles that are considered to be derived from an endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacterium. Although higher plants do not possess EC 2.3.1.37, the protistan Euglena gracilis possesses both the C(5) pathway and EC 2.3.1.37.</comment>	<comment>Forms part of the pathway for the biosynthesis of 5-aminolevulinate from glutamate, known as the C5 pathway, which is used in most eubacteria, and in all archaebacteria, algae and plants.

<comment>Chlorophyll degradation is a characteristic symptom of leaf senescence and fruit ripening. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme requires reduced ferredoxin, which is generated either by NADPH through the pentose-phosphate pathway or by the action of photosystem I (1,2). This reaction takes place without release of the substrate from EC 1.14.12.20, pheophorbide a oxygenase (3). Depending on the plant species used as the source of enzyme, one of two possible C-1 epimers of primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (pFCC), pFCC-1 or pFCC-2, is normally formed, with all genera or species within a family producing the same isomer (3,4). After modification and export, pFCCs are eventually imported into the vacuole, where the acidic environment causes their non-enzymic conversion into colorless breakdown products called non-fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs) (2).</comment>	<comment>Chlorophyll degradation is a characteristic symptom of leaf senescence and fruit ripening.

<comment>Contains FAD. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of glutaryl-CoA to glutaconyl-CoA (which remains bound to the enzyme), and the decarboxylation of the latter to crotonyl-CoA (cf. EC 4.1.1.70, glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase). FAD is the electron acceptor in the oxidation of the substrate, and its reoxidation by electron-transfer flavoprotein completes the catalytic cycle. The anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfococcus multivorans contains two glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases: a decarboxylating enzyme (this entry), and a non-decarboxylating enzyme that only catalyzes the oxidation to glutaconyl-CoA (EC 1.3.99.32).</comment>	<comment>The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of glutaryl-CoA to glutaconyl-CoA (which remains bound to the enzyme), and the decarboxylation of the latter to crotonyl-CoA (cf.

<comment>This enzyme differs from EC 1.3.3.3, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, by using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) instead of oxygen as oxidant. It occurs mainly in bacteria, whereas eukaryotes use the oxygen-dependent oxidase. The reaction starts by using an electron from the reduced form of the enzyme's [4Fe-4S] cluster to split AdoMet into methionine and the radical 5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl. This radical initiates attack on the 2-carboxyethyl groups, leading to their conversion into vinyl groups. This conversion, --.CH-CH(2)-COO(-) -&gt; --CH=CH(2) + CO(2) + e(-) replaces the electron initially used.</comment>	<comment>Differs from EC 1.3.3.3 by using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) instead of oxygen as oxidant.

<comment>A flavoprotein (FAD). A component of the multienzyme 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes. In the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, it binds to the core of EC 2.3.1.12, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase, and catalyzes oxidation of its dihydrolipoyl groups. It plays a similar role in the oxoglutarate and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase complexes. Another substrate is the dihydrolipoyl group in the H-protein of the glycine-cleavage system, in which it acts, together with EC 1.4.4.2, glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), and EC 2.1.2.10, aminomethyltransferase, to break down glycine. It can also use free dihydrolipoate, dihydrolipoamide or dihydrolipoyllysine as substrate. This enzyme was first shown to catalyze the oxidation of NADH by methylene blue; this activity was called diaphorase. The glycine cleavage system is composed of four components that only loosely associate: the P protein (EC 1.4.4.2), the T protein (EC 2.1.2.10), the L protein (EC 1.8.1.4) and the lipoyl-bearing H protein (6).</comment>	<comment>A component of the multienzyme 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes.

<comment>Contains a dinuclear center comprising two hemes, or heme and copper. Reduction of O(2) on the periplasmic side of the membrane leads to release of protons in the periplasm, generating a transmembrane proton gradient. In addition, the bb3 and bo oxidases, but not the bd oxidases, contribute to the proton gradient by actively pumping protons across the membrane.</comment>
<comment>The enzyme, described from the mitochondria of plants and some fungi and protists, is an alternative terminal oxidase that is not sensitive to cyanide inhibition and does not generate a proton motive force. Unlike the electrogenic terminal oxidases that contain hemes (cf. EC 1.10.3.10 and EC 1.10.3.14), this enzyme contains a dinuclear non-heme iron complex. The function of this oxidase is believed to be dissipating excess reducing power, minimizing oxidative stress, and optimizing photosynthesis in response to changing conditions.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme, described from the mitochondria of plants and some fungi and protists, is an alternative terminal oxidase that is not sensitive to cyanide inhibition and does not generate a proton motive force.

<comment>This terminal oxidase enzyme is unable to pump protons but generates a proton motive force by transmembrane charge separation resulting from utilizing protons and electrons originating from opposite sides of the membrane to generate water.

The bd-I oxidase from the bacterium Escherichia coli is the predominant respiratory oxygen reductase that functions under microaerophilic conditions in that organism. cf.

<comment>Along with EC 1.14.13.90, zeaxanthin epoxidase, this enzyme forms part of the xanthophyll (or violaxanthin) cycle for controlling the concentration of zeaxanthin in chloroplasts.

Zeaxanthin induces the dissipation of excitation energy in the chlorophyll of the light-harvesting protein complex of photosystem II. In higher plants the enzyme reacts with all-trans-diepoxides, such as violaxanthin, and all-trans-monoepoxides, but in the alga Mantoniella squamata, only the diepoxides are good substrates.</comment>	<comment>Along with EC 1.14.13.90, this enzyme forms part of the xanthophyll (or violaxanthin) cycle for controlling the concentration of zeaxanthin in chloroplasts.

<comment>Brings about the chlorination of a range of organic molecules, forming stable C-Cl bonds. Also oxidizes bromide and iodide. Enzymes of this type are either heme-thiolate proteins, or contain vanadate. A secreted enzyme produced by the ascomycetous fungus Caldariomyces fumago (Leptoxyphium fumago) is an example of the heme-thiolate type. It catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid by transferring one oxygen atom from H(2)O(2) to chloride. At a separate site it catalyzes the chlorination of activated aliphatic and aromatic substrates, via HClO and derived chlorine species. In the absence of halides, it shows peroxidase (e.g. phenol oxidation) and peroxygenase activities. The latter inserts oxygen from H(2)O(2) into, for example, styrene (side chain epoxidation) and toluene (benzylic hydroxylation), however, these activities are less pronounced than its activity with halides. Has little activity with non-activated substrates such as aromatic rings, ethers or saturated alkanes. The chlorinating peroxidase produced by ascomycetous fungi (e.g. Curvularia inaequalis) is an example of a vanadium chloroperoxidase, and is related to bromide peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.18). It contains vanadate and oxidizes chloride, bromide and iodide into hypohalous acids. In the absence of halides, it peroxygenates organic sulfides and oxidizes ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) but no phenols.</comment>

<comment>Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant proteins. They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys and 1-Cys peroxiredoxins (1). The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centered around a redox-active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine. All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common, in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid). The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three peroxiredoxin classes. For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving' cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several cell-specific thiol-containing reductants (R'-SH) (e.g. thioredoxin, AhpF, tryparedoxin or AhpD), completing the catalytic cycle. In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction forms an intrachain disulfide bond (1). To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to use thioredoxin as an electron donor (3). The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so that its oxidized form is directly reduced to cysteine by the reductant molecule (4).</comment>	<comment>Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant proteins.

<comment>Heme proteins with proximal histidine secreted by basidiomycetous fungi and eubacteria. They are similar to EC 1.11.1.16 versatile peroxidase (oxidation of Reactive Black 5, phenols, veratryl alcohol), but differ from the latter in their ability to efficiently oxidize a number of recalcitrant anthraquinone dyes, and inability to oxidize Mn(II).

<comment>A heme-thiolate protein (P450). Enzymes of this type include glycoproteins secreted by agaric basidiomycetes. They catalyze the insertion of an oxygen atom from H(2)O(2) into a wide variety of substrates, including aromatic rings such as naphthalene, toluene, phenanthrene, pyrene and p-nitrophenol, recalcitrant heterocycles such as pyridine, dibenzofuran, various ethers (resulting in O-dealkylation) and alkanes such as propane, hexane and cyclohexane. Reactions catalyzed include hydroxylation, epoxidation, N-oxidation, sulfooxidation, O- and N-dealkylation, bromination and one-electron oxidations. They have little or no activity toward chloride. Mechanistically, the catalytic cycle of unspecific (mono)-peroxygenases combines elements of the "shunt" pathway of cytochrome P450s (a side activity that utilizes a peroxide in place of dioxygen and NAD(P)H) and the classic heme peroxidase cycle.</comment>	<comment>Enzymes of this type include glycoproteins secreted by agaric basidiomycetes.

Catalytic turnover rates are high compared with those of monooxygenation reactions as well as peroxide shunt reactions catalyzed by the common P450s.

In vivo, the excited state luciferin--luciferase complex undergoes the process of nonradiative energy transfer to an accessory protein, Renilla green fluorescent protein, which results in green bioluminescence. In vitro, Renilla luciferase emits blue light in the absence of any green fluorescent protein.</comment>
<comment>Cypridina is a bioluminescent crustacea. The luciferins (and presumably the luciferases, since they cross-react) of some luminous fish (e.g. A-Pogon, Parapriacanthus, Porichthys) are apparently similar. The enzyme may be assayed by measurement of light emission.</comment>	<comment>Cypridina luciferin is a bioluminescent crustacea. The enzyme may be assayed by measurement of light emission.</comment>

<comment>This enzyme is one of the three enzymes involved in L-dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) catabolism in the non-oxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus OU5 (and not Rhodobacter sphaeroides OU5 as had been thought (1)), the other two being EC 4.3.1.22 (dihydroxyphenylalanine reductive deaminase) and EC 2.6.1.49 (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine transaminase). In addition to DOPA, the enzyme can also use L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan and glutamate as substrate, but more slowly.

<comment>Previously classified as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.32), but it is now recognized that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes to their nitronate (anionic) forms. The enzymes from the fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Williopsis saturnus var. mrakii (formerly classified as Hansenula mrakii) contain non-covalently bound FMN as the cofactor. Neither hydrogen peroxide nor superoxide were detected during enzyme turnover. Active toward linear alkyl nitronates of lengths between 2 and 6 carbon atoms and, with lower activity, toward propyl-2-nitronate. The enzyme from N. crassa can also utilize neutral nitroalkanes, but with lower activity.</comment>	<comment>Previously classified as EC 1.13.11.32, but it is now recognized that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes to their nitronate (anionic) forms.

<comment>The conversion of dichlorochromopyrrolate to dichloroarcyriaflavin A is a complex process that involves two enzyme components. RebP is an NAD-dependent cytochrome P(450) oxygenase that performs an aryl-aryl bond formation yielding the six-ring indolocarbazole scaffold (1). Along with RebC, a flavin-dependent hydroxylase, it also catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of both carboxyl groups. The presence of RebC ensures that the only product is the rebeccamycin aglycone dichloroarcyriaflavin A (2). The enzymes are similar, but not identical, to StaP and StaC, which are involved in the synthesis of staurosporine (3).</comment>	<comment>The conversion of dichlorochromopyrrolate to dichloroarcyriaflavin A is a complex process that involves two enzyme components.

<comment>This enzyme catalyzes the first reaction in the pathway of carbazole degradation. The enzyme attacks at the 1 and 9a positions of carbazole, resulting in the formation of a highly unstable hemiaminal intermediate that undergoes a spontaneous cleavage and rearomatization, resulting in 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol. In most bacteria the enzyme is a complex composed of a terminal oxygenase, a ferredoxin, and a ferredoxin reductase. The terminal oxygenase component contains a nonheme iron center and a Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster.</comment>

<comment>A flavoprotein. A broad spectrum monooxygenase that accepts substrates as diverse as hydrazines, phosphines, boron-containing compounds, sulfides, selenides, iodide, as well as primary, secondary and tertiary amines (3,4). This enzyme is distinct from other monooxygenases in that the enzyme forms a relatively stable hydroperoxy flavin intermediate (4,5). This microsomal enzyme generally converts nucleophilic heteroatom-containing chemicals and drugs into harmless, readily excreted metabolites. For example, N-oxygenation is largely responsible for the detoxification of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (2,6).</comment>	<comment>A broad spectrum monooxygenase that accepts substrates as diverse as hydrazines, phosphines, boron-containing compounds, sulfides, selenides, iodide, as well as primary, secondary and tertiary amines.

<comment>This heme thiolate (P450) enzyme, found in several bacterial pathogens, is involved in degradation of the host cholesterol. It catalyzes the hydroxylation of the C26 carbon, followed by oxidation of the alcohol to the carboxylic acid via the aldehyde intermediate (4). These activities are required to initiate the degradation of the alkyl side-chain of cholesterol. The enzyme also accepts cholesterol as a substrate, but unlike EC 1.14.13.15, cholestanetriol 26-monooxygenase, this enzyme is specific for C26 and prefers cholest-4-en-3-one.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme, found in several bacterial pathogens, is involved in degradation of the host cholesterol.

<comment>The spinach enzyme, which is located in the chloroplast, contains a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, and probably also a mononuclear Fe center. Requires Mg(2+). Catalyzes the first step of glycine betaine synthesis. In many bacteria, plants and animals, betaine is synthesized in two steps: (1) choline to betaine aldehyde and (2) betaine aldehyde to betaine. Different enzymes are involved in the first reaction. In plants, the reaction is catalyzed by this enzyme whereas in animals and many bacteria, it is catalyzed by either membrane-bound EC 1.1.99.1 (choline dehydrogenase) or soluble EC 1.1.3.17 (choline oxidase) (7). The enzyme involved in the second step, EC 1.2.1.8, betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase, appears to be the same in plants, animals and bacteria. In some bacteria, betaine is synthesized from glycine through the actions of EC 2.1.1.156 (glycine/sarcosine N-methyltransferase) and EC 2.1.1.157 (sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase).</comment>	<comment>Catalyzes the first step of glycine betaine synthesis.

<comment>A type III copper protein found in a broad variety of bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, crustaceans, and mammals, which is involved in the synthesis of betalains and melanin. The enzyme, which is activated upon binding molecular oxygen, can catalyze both a monophenolase reaction cycle (reaction 1) or a diphenolase reaction cycle (reaction 2). During the monophenolase cycle, one of the bound oxygen atoms is transferred to a monophenol (such as L-tyrosine), generating an O-diphenol intermediate, which is subsequently oxidized to an o-quinone and released, along with a water molecule. The enzyme remains in an inactive deoxy state, and is restored to the active oxy state by the binding of a new oxygen molecule. During the diphenolase cycle the enzyme binds an external diphenol molecule (such as L-dopa) and oxidizes it to an O-quinone that is released along with a water molecule, leaving the enzyme in the intermediate met state. The enzyme then binds a second diphenol molecule and repeats the process, ending in a deoxy state (7). The second reaction is identical to that catalyzed by the related enzyme catechol oxidase (EC 1.10.3.1). However, the latter can not catalyze the hydroxylation or monooxygenation of monophenols.</comment>	<comment>Found in a broad variety of bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, crustaceans, and mammals, which is involved in the synthesis of betalains and melanin.

<comment>This enzyme, which has been found mainly in plants, introduces a double bond at Delta(8) of C(18) and C(20) fatty acids (2).

<comment>Requires ATP. The reaction in mammals possibly involves dehydrogenation to give a 24(25)-double bond followed by hydration (1). However, in amphibians such as the Oriental fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis), it is probable that the product is formed via direct hydroxylation of the saturated side chain of (25R)-3-alpha,7-alpha,12-alpha-trihydroxy-5-beta-cholestan-26-oate and not via hydration of a 24(25) double bond (5).

<comment>Under physiological conditions, the reactions occur in the reverse direction to that shown above. This enzyme is highly specific for bile-acid substrates and requires a free C-24 carboxy group and an unhindered 7-alpha-hydroxy group on the B-ring of the steroid nucleus for activity, as found in cholate and chenodeoxycholate. The reaction is stimulated by the presence of NAD(+) but is inhibited by excess NADH. This unusual regulation by the NAD(+)/NADH ratio is most likely the result of the intermediates being linked at C-24 by an anhydride bond to the 5'-diphosphate of 3'-phospho-ADP (2,5,6). Allo-deoxycholate is also formed as a side-product of the 7-alpha-dehydroxylation of cholate (6). The enzyme is present in intestinal anaerobic bacteria (6), even though its products are important in mammalian physiology.</comment>	<comment>Under physiological conditions, the reactions occur in the reverse direction to that shown above.

<comment>Requires Mg(2+). It is composed of two proteins that can be separated but are both required for nitrogenase activity. Dinitrogen reductase is a [4Fe-4S] protein, which, with two molecules of ATP and ferredoxin, generates an electron. The electron is transferred to the other protein, dinitrogenase (molybdoferredoxin). Dinitrogenase is a molybdenum-iron protein that reduces dinitrogen in three succesive two-electron reductions from nitrogen to diimine to hydrazine to two molecules of ammonia. The molybdenum may be replaced by vanadium or iron. The reduction is initiated by formation of hydrogen in stoichiometric amounts (2). Acetylene is reduced to ethylene (but only very slowly to ethane), azide to nitrogen and ammonia, and cyanide to methane and ammonia. In the absence of a suitable substrate, hydrogen is slowly formed. Ferredoxin may be replaced by flavodoxin (see EC 1.19.6.1 nitrogenase (flavodoxin)).

Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalyzed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and EC 1.16.1.8, (methionine synthase) reductase. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and EC 1.18.1.2, ferredoxin--NADP+ reductase). Acts on the monoglutamate as well as the triglutamate folate, in contrast with EC 2.1.1.14, 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate--homocysteine S-methyltransferase, which acts only on the triglutamate.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II).

<comment>This enzyme is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Ubiquinones from different organisms have a different number of prenyl units (for example, ubiquinone-6 in Saccharomyces, ubiquinone-9 in rat and ubiquinone-10 in human), and thus the natural substrate for the enzymes from different organisms has a different number of prenyl units. However, the enzyme usually shows a low degree of specificity regarding the number of prenyl units. For example, when the COQ5 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is introduced into Escherichia coli, it complements the respiratory deficiency of an ubiE mutant (3). The bifunctional enzyme from E. coli also catalyzes the methylation of demethylmenaquinol-8 (this activity is classified as EC 2.1.1.163) (1).</comment>	<comment>This enzyme is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis.

<comment>The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for complete 5-methylcytosine methylations of yeast tRNA. The incidence of modification depends on the cytosine position in tRNA. At positions 34 and 40, 5-methylcytosine is found only in two yeast tRNAs (tRNA(Leu)(CUA) and tRNA(Phe)(GAA), respectively), whereas most other elongator yeast tRNAs bear either 5-methylcytosine(48) or 5-methylcytosine(49), but never both in the same tRNA molecule (1). The formation of 5-methylcytosine(34) and 5-methylcytosine(40) is a strictly intron-dependent process, whereas the formation of 5-methylcytosine(48) and 5-methylcytosine(49) is an intron-independent process (2,3).</comment>	<comment>The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for complete 5-methylcytosine methylations of yeast tRNA.

<comment>The enzyme, which is involved in methanogenesis from methylated thiols, such as methane thiol, dimethyl sulfide, and 3-S-methylmercaptopropionate, catalyzes two successive steps - the transfer of a methyl group from the substrate to the cobalt cofactor of a methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein (MtsB), and the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from the corrinoid protein to coenzyme M. With most other methanogenesis substrates this process is carried out by two different enzymes (for example, EC 2.1.1.90, methanol--corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, and EC 2.1.1.246, methylated methanol-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase). The cobalt is oxidized during methylation from the Co(I) state to the Co(III) state, and is reduced back to the Co(I) form during demethylation.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme, which is involved in methanogenesis from methylated thiols, such as methane thiol, dimethyl sulfide, and 3-S-methylmercaptopropionate, catalyzes two successive steps - the transfer of a methyl group from the substrate to the cobalt cofactor of a methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein (MtsB), and the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from the corrinoid protein to coenzyme M.

<comment>This enzyme, along with EC 2.3.1.38, [acyl-carrier-protein] S-acetyltransferase, is essential for the initiation of fatty-acid biosynthesis in bacteria. This enzyme also provides the malonyl groups for polyketide biosynthesis (7). The product of the reaction, malonyl-ACP, is an elongation substrate in fatty-acid biosynthesis. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, holo-ACP (the product of EC 2.7.8.7, holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase) is the preferred substrate (5). This enzyme also forms part of the multienzyme complexes EC 4.1.1.88 (biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase) and EC 4.1.1.89 (biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase). Malonylation of ACP is immediately followed by decarboxylation within the malonate-decarboxylase complex to yield acetyl-ACP, the catalytically active species of the decarboxylase (12). In the enzyme from Klebsiella pneumoniae, methylmalonyl-CoA can also act as a substrate but acetyl-CoA cannot (10) whereas the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida can use both as substrates (11).

Biosynthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B requires 28 active sites that are precisely arranged along three large polypeptides, denoted DEBS1, -2 and -3 (6). The polyketide product is synthesized by the processive action of a loading didomain, six extension modules and a terminal thioesterase domain (5). Each extension module contains a minimum of a ketosynthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT) and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The KS domain both accepts the growing polyketide chain from the previous module and catalyzes the subsequent decarboxylative condensation between this substrate and an ACP-bound methylmalonyl extender unit, introduce by the AT domain. This combined effort gives rise to a new polyketide intermediate that has been extended by two carbon atoms (5).</comment>	<comment>The product, 6-deoxyerythronolide B, contains a 14-membered lactone ring and is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of erythromycin antibiotics.

<comment>A multimer (24-mer) of this enzyme forms the core of the multienzyme 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase complex, and binds tightly both EC 1.2.4.4, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (2-methylpropanoyl-transferring) and EC 1.8.1.4, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. The lipoyl group of this enzyme is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by  EC 1.2.4.4, and the only observed direction catalyzed by EC 2.3.1.168 is that where this 2-methylpropanoyl is passed to coenzyme A. In addition to the 2-methylpropanoyl group, formed when EC 1.2.4.4 acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the 3-methylbutanoyl and S-2-methylbutanoyl groups, donated to it when EC 1.2.4.4 acts on the oxo acids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine.</comment>	<comment>A multimer (24-mer) of this enzyme forms the core of the multienzyme 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase complex, and binds tightly both EC 1.2.4.4 and EC 1.8.1.4.

<comment>Involved in the dissociated (or type II) fatty acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria. While the substrate specificity of this enzyme is very similar to that of EC 2.3.1.41, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I, it differs in that palmitoleoyl-ACP is not a good substrate of EC 2.3.1.41 but is an excellent substrate of this enzyme (1,2). The fatty-acid composition of Escherichia coli changes as a function of growth temperature, with the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids increasing with lower growth temperature. This enzyme controls the temperature-dependent regulation of fatty-acid composition, with mutants lacking this acivity being deficient in the elongation of palmitoleate to cis-vaccenate at low temperatures (3,4).</comment>	<comment>Involved in the dissociated (or type II) fatty acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria.

<comment>Involved in the dissociated (or type II) fatty-acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria. In contrast to EC 2.3.1.41 (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) and EC 2.3.1.179 (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II), this enzyme specifically uses CoA thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer (1). In addition to the above reaction, the enzyme can also catalyze the reaction of EC 2.3.1.38, [acyl-carrier-protein] S-acetyltransferase, but to a much lesser extent (1). The enzyme is responsible for initiating both straight- and branched-chain fatty-acid biosynthesis (2), with the substrate specificity in an organism reflecting the fatty-acid composition found in that organism (2,5). For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive bacterium, is able to use both straight- and branched-chain (C4--C6) acyl-CoA primers (3) whereas Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative organism, uses primarily short straight-chain acyl CoAs, with a preference for acetyl-CoA (4,5).</comment>	<comment>Involved in the dissociated (or type II) fatty-acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria.

<comment>This is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipoyl cofactor. The lipoyl cofactor is essential for the function of several key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, as it converts apoprotein into the biologically active holoprotein. Examples of such lipoylated proteins include pyruvate dehydrogenase (E(2) domain), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E(2) domain), the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system (H protein) (2,3). Lipoyl-ACP can also act as a substrate (4) although octanoyl-ACP is likely to be the true substrate (6). The other enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lipoyl cofactor is EC 2.8.1.8, lipoyl synthase. An alternative lipoylation pathway involves EC 2.7.7.63, lipoate--protein ligase, which can lipoylate apoproteins using exogenous lipoic acid (or its analogs).</comment>	<comment>The first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipoyl cofactor.

<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing. Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which, in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes (5). N-(3-Oxohexanoyl)-[acyl-carrier-protein] and hexanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] are the best substrates (1). The fatty-acyl substrate is derived from fatty-acid biosynthesis through acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] rather than from fatty-acid degradation through acyl-CoA (1). S-adenosyl-L-methionine cannot be replaced by methionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, homoserine or homoserine lactone (1).</comment>	<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.

<comment>This is the first component of the elongase, a microsomal protein complex responsible for extending palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (and modified forms thereof) to very-long-chain acyl CoAs.

<comment>The first reaction of this enzyme is to catalyze its own glucosylation, normally at Tyr-194 of the protein if this group is free. When Tyr-194 is replaced by Thr or Phe, the enzyme's Mn(2+)-dependent self-glucosylation activity is lost but its intermolecular transglucosylation ability remains (7). It continues to glucosylate an existing glucosyl group until a length of about 5-13 residues has been formed. Further lengthening of the glycogen chain is then carried out by EC 2.4.1.11, glycogen (starch) synthase. The enzyme is not highly specific for the donor, using UDP-xylose in addition to UDP-glucose (although not glucosylating or xylosylating a xylosyl group so added). It can also use CDP-glucose and TDP-glucose, but not ADP-glucose or GDP-glucose. Similarly it is not highly specific for the acceptor, using water (i.e. hydrolyzing UDP-glucose) among others. Various forms of the enzyme exist, and different forms predominate in different organs. Thus primate liver contains glycogenin-2, of molecular mass 66 kDa, whereas the more widespread form is glycogenin-1, with a molecular mass of 38 kDa.</comment>	<comment>The first reaction of this enzyme is to catalyze its own glucosylation, normally at a specific Tyr of the protein if this group is free; when the Tyr is replaced by Thr or Phe, the enzyme's self-glucosylation activity is lost but its intermolecular transglucosylation ability remains.

<comment>Requires Mg(2+). Diacylglycerol cannot serve as an acceptor molecule for galactosylation as in the reaction catalyzed by EC 2.4.1.46, monogalactosyldiacylglyerol synthase. When phosphate is limiting, phospholipids in plant membranes are reduced but these are replaced, at least in part, by the glycolipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (3). While both DGD1 and DGD2 are increased under phosphate-limiting conditions, DGD2 does not contribute significantly under optimal growth conditions. DGD2 is responsible for the synthesis of DGDG molecular species that are rich in C(16) fatty acids at sn-1 of diacylglycerol whereas DGD1 leads to molecular species rich in C(18) fatty acids (3). The enzyme has been localized to the outer side of chloroplast envelope membranes.</comment>	<comment>Diacylglycerol cannot serve as an acceptor molecule for galactosylation as in the reaction catalyzed by EC 2.4.1.46.

<comment>This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the terminal (2-&gt;1)-linked beta-D-fructosyl group of a mono- or oligosaccharide substituent on O-1 of the fructose residue of sucrose onto O-6 of its glucose residue (1). For example, if 1-kestose (1(F)-(beta-D-fructofuranosyl)sucrose) is both the donor and recipient in the reaction shown above, i.e., if m = 1 and n = 1, then the products will be sucrose and 6(G)-di-beta-D-fructofuranosylsucrose. In this notation, the superscripts F and G are used to specify whether the fructose or glucose residue of the sucrose carries the substituent. Alternatively, this may be indicated by the presence and/or absence of primes (see 2-carb-36.2). Sucrose cannot be a donor substrate in the reaction (i.e. m cannot be zero) and inulin cannot act as an acceptor. Side reactions catalyzed are transfer of a beta-D-fructosyl group between compounds of the structure 1(F)-(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)(m)-6(G)-(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)(n) sucrose, where m &gt;= 0 and n = 1 for the donor, and m &gt;= 0 and n &gt;= 0 for the acceptor.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the terminal (2-&gt;1)-linked beta-D-fructosyl group of a mono- or oligosaccharide substituent on O-1 of the fructose residue of sucrose onto O-6 of its glucose residue.

<comment>The enzyme from human can transfer N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) to N-glycan and O-glycan substrates that have N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) but not D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) at their non-reducing end. The N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group is normally on a core oligosaccharide although benzyl glycosides have been used in enzyme-characterization experiments. Some glycohormones, e.g. lutropin and thyrotropin contain the N-glycan structure containing the N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1-&gt;4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group.</comment>

<comment>Occurs in eukaryotes that form a glycoprotein by the transfer of a glucosyl-mannosyl-glucosamine polysaccharide to the side-chain of an L-asparagine residue in the sequence -Asn-Xaa-Ser- or -Asn-Xaa-Thr- (Xaa not Pro) in nascent polypeptide chains. The basic oligosaccharide is the tetradecasaccharide Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2). However, smaller oligosaccharides derived from it and oligosaccharides with additional monosaccharide units attached may be involved. See ref (2) for a review of N-glycoproteins in eukaryotes. Man(3)GlcNAc(2) seems to be common for all of the oligosaccharides involved with the terminal N-acetylglucosamine linked to the protein L-asparagine.

<comment>The corrinoid adenosylation pathway comprises three steps: (i) reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) by a one-electron transfer. This can be carried out by EC 1.16.1.3, or non-enzymically in the presence of dihydroflavin nucleotides. (2) Co(II) is reduced to Co(I) in a second single-electron transfer by EC 1.16.1.4, cob(II)alamin reductase and (iii) the Co(I) conducts a nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl moiety of ATP to leave the cobalt atom in a Co(III) state (EC 2.5.1.17). The enzyme responsible for the adenosylation reaction is the product of the gene cobO in the aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas denitrificans and of the gene cobA in the anaerobic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. In P. denitrificans, the enzyme shows specificity for cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide and the corrinoids that occur later in the biosynthetic pathway whereas CobA seems to have broader specificity (3).

<comment>This enzyme, along with geranylgeranyltransferase types I (EC 2.5.1.59) and II (EC 2.5.1.60), constitutes the protein prenyltransferase family of enzymes. Catalyzes the formation of a thioether linkage between the C-1 of an isoprenyl group and a cysteine residue fourth from the C-terminus of the protein.

<comment>This enzyme, along with protein farnesyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.58) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (EC 2.5.1.59), constitutes the protein prenyltransferase family of enzymes. Attaches geranylgeranyl groups to two C-terminal cysteines in Ras-related GTPases of a single family, the Rab family (Ypt/Sec4 in lower eukaryotes) that terminate in XXCC, XCXC and CCXX motifs. Reaction is entirely dependent on the Rab substrate being bound to Rab escort protein (REP). Post-translational modification with the geranylgeranyl moiety is essential for Rab GTPases to be able to control the processes of membrane docking and fusion (5).</comment>	<comment>This enzyme, along with EC 2.5.1.58 and EC 2.5.1.59, constitutes the protein prenyltransferase family of enzymes.

<comment>The enzyme works by stepwise addition of pyrrolylmethyl groups until a hexapyrrole is present at the active center. The terminal tetrapyrrole is then hydrolyzed to yield the product, leaving a cysteine-bound dipyrrole on which assembly continues. In the presence of a second enzyme, EC 4.2.1.75 (uroporphyrinogen-III synthase), which is often called cosynthase, the product is cyclized to form uroporphyrinogen-III. If EC 4.2.1.75 is absent, the hydroxymethylbilane cyclizes spontaneously to form uroporphyrinogen I.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme works by stepwise addition of pyrrolylmethyl groups until a hexapyrrole is present at the active center.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the arginine-inducible succinylornithine transaminase, acetylornithine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.11) and ornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13) activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme, but this is not the case in all species (5). This is the third enzyme in the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway for the catabolism of arginine (1). This pathway converts the carbon skeleton of arginine into glutamate, with the concomitant production of ammonia and conversion of succinyl-CoA into succinate and CoA. The five enzymes involved in this pathway are EC 2.3.1.109 (arginine N-succinyltransferase), EC 3.5.3.23 (N-succinylarginine dihydrolase), EC 2.6.1.81 (succinylornithine transaminase), EC 1.2.1.71 (succinylglutamate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) and EC 3.5.1.96 (succinylglutamate desuccinylase) (3, 6).</comment>	<comment>Also acts on N(2)-acetyl-L-ornithine and L-ornithine, but more slowly.

<comment>The delta subunit of malonate decarboxylase serves as an an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) and contains the prosthetic group 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA. Two reactions are involved in the production of the holo-ACP form of this enzyme. The first reaction is catalyzed by EC 2.4.2.52, triphosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA synthase. The resulting prosthetic group is then attached to the ACP subunit via a phosphodiester linkage to a serine residue, thus forming the holo form of the enzyme, in a manner analogous to that of EC 2.7.7.61, citrate lyase holo-[acyl-carrier protein] synthase.</comment>	<comment>The delta subunit of malonate decarboxylase serves as an an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) and contains the prosthetic group 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA.

While the enzyme from some species is activated by actin, in other cases Ca(2+)/calmodulin are required for activity.</comment>	<comment>Formerly EC 2.7.1.129.</comment>
<comment>This enzyme is activated during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Following Fas ligation, the enzyme, which is constitutively phosphorylated, is dephosphorylated, and it is the dephosphorylated form that causes phosphorylation of TIA-1, a nuclear RNA-binding protein. Phosphorylation of TIA-1 precedes the onset of DNA fragmentation. Formerly EC 2.7.1.37.</comment>

<comment>The enzyme phosphorylates I-kappa-B proteins at specific serine residues, which marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway.

<comment>cAMP is required to activate this enzyme. The inactive holoenzyme of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a tetramer composed of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP molecules and two free monomeric catalytic subunits (i.e. R(2)C(2) + 4 cAMP = R(2)(cAMP)(4) + 2 C). Formerly EC 2.7.1.37.</comment>
<comment>cGMP is required to activate this enzyme. The enzyme occurs as a dimer in higher eukaryotes. The C-terminal region of each polypeptide chain contains the catalytic domain that includes the ATP and protein substrate binding sites. This domain catalyzes the phosphorylation by ATP to specific serine or threonine residues in protein substrates (3). The enzyme also has two allosteric cGMP-binding sites (sites A and B). Binding of cGMP causes a conformational change that is associated with activation of the kinase (4).</comment>	<comment>cGMP is required to activate this enzyme.

<comment>The enzyme binds a [4Fe-4S] and a [2Fe-2S] cluster. In every reaction cycle, the enzyme consumes two molecules of AdoMet, each producing 5'-deoxyadenosine and a putative dethiobiotinyl carbon radical. Reaction with another equivalent of AdoMet results in abstraction of the C6 methylene pro-(S) hydrogen atom from 9-mercaptodethiobiotin, and the resulting carbon radical is quenched via formation of an intramolecular C-S bond, thus closing the biotin thiophane ring. The sulfur donor (S) is believed to be the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is sacrificed in the process, so that in vitro the reaction is a single turnover. In vivo, the [2Fe-2S] cluster can be reassembled by the Isc or Suf iron-sulfur cluster assembly systems, to allow further catalysis.</comment>

<comment>This enzyme is a member of the 'AdoMet radical' (radical SAM) family, all members of which produce the 5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl radical and methionine from AdoMet (i.e. S-adenosylmethionine, or S-(5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl)methionine), by the addition of an electron from an iron-sulfur center. The radical is converted into 5'-deoxyadenosine when it abstracts a hydrogen atom from C-6 and C-8, leaving reactive radicals at these positions so that they can add sulfur, with inversion of configuration (4). This enzyme catalyzes the final step in the de-novo biosynthesis of the lipoyl cofactor, with the other enzyme involved being EC 2.3.1.181, lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase. Lipoylation is essential for the function of several key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, as it converts apoprotein into the biologically active holoprotein. Examples of such lipoylated proteins include pyruvate dehydrogenase (E(2) domain), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E(2) domain), the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system (2,5). An alternative lipoylation pathway involves EC 2.7.7.63, lipoate--protein ligase, which can lipoylate apoproteins using exogenous lipoic acid (or its analogs) (7).</comment>	<comment>Member of the 'AdoMet radical' (radical SAM) family, all members of which produce the 5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl radical and methionine from AdoMet (i.e. S-adenosylmethionine, or S-(5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl)methionine), by the addition of an electron from an iron-sulfur center.

<comment>The substrate is lipid A on the reducing end of the toxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium and related organisms. It consists of diglucosamine, beta-D-GlcN-(1-&gt;6)-D-GlcN, attached by glycosylation on O-6 of its non-reducing residue, phosphorylated on O-4 of this residue and on O-1 of its potentially reducing residue. Both residues carry 3-(acyloxy)acyl groups on N-2 and O-3. The enzyme from human leukocytes detoxifies the lipid by hydrolyzing the secondary acyl groups from O-3 of the 3-hydroxyacyl groups on the disaccharide (LPS). It also possesses a wide range of phospholipase and acyltransferase activities (e.g. EC 3.1.1.4, EC 3.1.1.5, EC 3.1.1.32 and EC 3.1.1.52), hydrolyzing diacylglycerol and phosphatidyl compounds, but not triacylglycerols.

It exhibits a preference for the 1- or 3-ester bond of its acylglycerol substrate compared with the 2-ester bond (8). The enzyme shows little preference for the fatty acids in the triacylglycerol, although there is some increase in activity with decreasing chain length. The enzyme activity is increased in response to hormones that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme is a serine hydrolase.

<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing. Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which, in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes (5). Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeutic advantage in avoiding bacterial infection as they could prevent AHL-signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensing bacteria (5). N-(3-Oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone can act as substrates (5).</comment>	<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.

<comment>These enzymes can also remove the 5-phosphate from Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and/or Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4). They are a diverse family of enzymes, with differing abilities to catalyze two or more of the four reactions listed. They are thought to use inositol lipids rather than inositol phosphates as substrates in vivo. All of them can use either or both of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) as substrates; this is the main property that distinguishes them from EC 3.1.3.56.</comment>

Activation of apo-ACP to form the holoenzyme is carried out by EC 2.7.8.7, holo-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme cleaves acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] species with acyl chains of 6-16 carbon atoms although it appears to demonstrate a preference for the unacylated acyl-carrier-protein (ACP) and short-chain ACPs over the medium- and long-chain species.

<comment>RNase E is a bacterial ribonuclease that plays a role in the processing of ribosomal RNA (9S to 5S rRNA), the chemical degradation of bulk cellular RNA, the decay of specific regulatory, messenger and structural RNAs and the control of plasmid DNA replication (1). The enzyme binds to monophosphorylated 5' ends of substrates but exhibits sequential cleavages in the 3' to 5' direction (1). 2'-O-Methyl nucleotide substitutions at RNase E binding sites do not prevent binding but do prevent cleavage of non-modified target sequences 5' to that locus (1). In Escherichia coli, the enzyme is found in the RNA degradosome. The C-terminal half of the protein contains binding sites for the three other major degradosomal components, the DEAD-box RNA helicase Rh1B, enolase (EC 4.1.1.11) and polynucleotide phosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.8).</comment>	<comment>RNase E is a bacterial ribonuclease that plays a role in the processing of ribosomal RNA (9S to 5S rRNA), the chemical degradation of bulk cellular RNA, the decay of specific regulatory, messenger and structural RNAs and the control of plasmid DNA replication.

<comment>A whole spectrum of chitosanases are now known (for more details, see  http://pages.usherbrooke.ca/rbrzezinski/). They can hydrolyze various types of links in chitosan. The only constant property is the endohydrolysis of GlcN-GlcN links, which is common to all known chitosanases. One known chitosanase is limited to this link recognition (4), while the majority can also recognize GlcN-GlcNAc links or GlcNAc-GlcN links but not both. They also do not recognize GlcNAc-GlcNAc links in partly acetylated chitosan.</comment>	<comment>A whole spectrum of chitosanases are now known that can hydrolyze various types of links in chitosan.

<comment>The enzyme from Streptomyces specifically hydrolyzes the terminal lacto-N-biosyl residue (beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;3)-D-GlcNAc) from the non-reducing end of oligosaccharides with the structure beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;R). Lacto-N-hexaose (beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;4)-D-Glc) is hydrolyzed to form first lacto-N-tetraose plus lacto-N-biose, with the subsequent formation of lactose. Oligosaccharides in which the non-reducing terminal Gal or the penultimate GlcNAc are replaced by fucose or sialic acid are not substrates. Asialo GM1 tetraose (beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;4)-D-Glc) is hydrolyzed very slowly, but lacto-N-neotetraose (beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;4)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1-&gt;3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-&gt;4)-D-Glc) is not a substrate.</comment>

<comment>The enzyme removes XXXG heptasaccharides, XXLG/XLXG octasaccharides and XLLG nonasaccharides from the end of tamarind seed xyloglucan polymers in a processive manner. Hydrolysis occurs at the unsubstituted D-glucopyranose residue in the main backbone. It is not known whether the cleavage takes place at the reducing or non-reducing end of the polymer. Very low activity with beta-D-glucans. The enzyme from Chrysosporium lucknowense shifts to an endoglucanase mode when acting on linear substrates without bulky substituents on the polymeric backbone such as barley beta-glucan.

<comment>The enzyme, originally isolated from the bacterium Bacillus halodurans C-125, releases the xylose unit at the reducing end of oligosaccharides ending with the structure beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-&gt;4)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-&gt;4)-beta-D-xylopyranose, leaving the new reducing end in the alpha configuration. It is specific for the beta anomers of xylooligosaccharides whose degree of polymerization is equal to or greater than 3. The penultimate residue must be beta-D-xylopyranose, but replacing either of the flanking residues with glucose merely slows the rate greatly.</comment>

Ginsenoside Rb1 beta-glucosidase specifically and sequentially hydrolyzes the 20-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-&gt;6)-beta-D glucopyranosyloxy) residues attached to position 20 by first hydrolyzing the (1-&gt;6)-glucosidic bond to generate ginsenoside Rd as an intermediate, followed by hydrolysis of the remaining 20-O-beta-D-glucosidic bond.</comment>

<comment>RecA protein and single-stranded DNA are required for activity, which is attributed to a Ser/Lys dyad (2). The LexA protein represses the SOS regulon, which regulates the genes involved in DNA repair. In the presence of single-stranded DNA, the RecA protein interacts with repressor LexA, causing it to undergo an autocatalytic cleavage which disrupts the DNA-binding part of the repressor, and inactivates it. The consequent derepression of the SOS regulon leads to DNA repair. This peptidase activity of LexA was previously attributed to the RecA protein (formerly EC 3.4.99.37). Type example of peptidase family S24.</comment>	<comment>In the presence of single-stranded DNA, the RecA protein interacts with LexA causing an autocatalytic cleavage which disrupts the DNA-binding part of LexA, leading to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually DNA repair.

<comment>This type-II membrane-associated serine peptidase has been implicated in cell growth and development (1,3). The enzyme has been shown to activate blood coagulation factor VII by cleavage of the Arg(152)-|-Ile(153) peptide bound in BHK cells, thus indicating a possible role in the initiation of blood coagulation (2). There is no cleavage after aromatic or aliphatic residues (1).

<comment>This serine endopeptidase is essential for the clearance of denatured or aggregated proteins from the inner-membrane and periplasmic space in Escherichia coli. Natural substrates of the enzyme include colicin A lysis protein, pilin subunits and MalS from E. coli (3). The enzyme has weak peptidase activity with casein and other non-native substrates (3). The peptidase acts as a chaperone at low temperatures but switches to a peptidase (heat shock protein) at higher temperatures (1,6). Molecular chaperones and peptidases control the folded state of proteins by recognizing hydrophobic stretches of polypeptide that become exposed by misfolding or unfolding. They then bind these hydrophobic substrates to prevent aggregation or assist in protein refolding. If attempts at refolding fail, then irreversibly damaged proteins are degraded by peptidases such as this enzyme (6).

This enzyme, which resides in the N-terminal region of NS3 (nonstructural protein 3), is essential for generation of its own C-terminus and for processing of the downstream cleavage sites, leading to the release of the pestivirus nonstructural proteins NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B (1,2).

<comment>In the equine arterivirus (EAV), the replicase gene is translated into open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1ab polyproteins. This enzyme is the main viral proteinase and processes five cleavage sites in the ORF1a protein and three in the ORF1b-encoded part of the ORF1ab protein to yield nonstructural proteins (nsp5-nsp12) (3). It combines the catalytic system of a chymotrypsin-like serine peptidase (His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad) with the substrate specificity of a 3C-like serine peptidase (Glu or Gln) at the P1 position and a small amino-acid residue (Gly, Ser or Ala) at the P1' position (1). Cleavage of ORF1ab by this enzyme is essential for viral replication (2).

<comment>Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a birnavirus that causes an acute, contagious disease in young salmonid fish (2). As with most viruses that infect eukaryotic cells, the proteolytic processing of viral precursor proteins is a crucial step in the life cycle of this virus (2). pVP2 is converted into VP2 by cleavage near the carboxy end of pVP2. This cleavage is most likely due to host-cell proteases rather than VP4 (2,3). Differs from most serine peptidases in not having the catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp (2).

<comment>This enzyme plays a central role in a regulatory checkpoint (the sigma(K) checkpoint), which coordinates gene expression during the later stages of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis (1,3). The enzyme activates proteolytic processing of a sporulation-specific sigma factor, pro-sigma(K), to its mature and active form, sigma(K), by self-cleavage (1,3). The enzyme is also subject to secondary proteolysis, which presumably inactivates SpoIVB (3). The enzyme is also essential for the formation of heat-resistant spores.

<comment>The egg envelope of the South African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) is modified during transit of the egg through the pars rectus oviduct, changing the egg envelope from an unfertilizable form to a fertilizable form. This process involves the conversion of glycoprotein gp43 to gp41 (ZPC) by the pars recta protease oviductin. It is thought that the enzymatically active protease molecule comprises the N-terminal protease domain coupled to two C-terminal CUB domains, which are related to the mammalian spermadhesin molecules implicated in mediating sperm-envelope interactions (2).

<comment>Caspase-2 is an initiator caspase, as are caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61), caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.63) (6). Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminal prodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation (6). Two forms of caspase-2 exist that have antagonistic effects: caspase-2L induces programd cell death and caspase-2S suppresses cell death (2,3,5). Caspase-2 is activated by caspase-3 (EC 3.4.22.56), or by a caspase-3-like protease. Activation involves cleavage of the N-terminal prodomain, followed by self-proteolysis between the large and small subunits of pro-caspase-2 and further proteolysis into smaller fragments (3). Proteolysis occurs at Asp residues and the preferred substrate for this enzyme is a pentapeptide rather than a tetrapeptide (5). A-Part from itself, the enzyme can cleave golgin-16, which is present in the Golgi complex and has a cleavage site that is unique for caspase-2 (4,5). alpha-II-Spectrin, a component of the membrane cytoskeleton, is a substrate of the large isoform of pro-caspase-2 (caspase-2L) but not of the short isoform (caspase-2S).

Activation involves cleavage of the N-terminal prodomain, followed by self-proteolysis between the large and small subunits of pro-caspase-2 and further proteolysis into smaller fragments. Proteolysis occurs at Asp residues and the preferred substrate for this enzyme is a pentapeptide rather than a tetrapeptide. A-Part from itself, the enzyme can cleave golgin-16, which is present in the Golgi complex and has a cleavage site that is unique for caspase-2. alpha-II-spectrin, a component of the membrane cytoskeleton, is a substrate of the large isoform of pro-caspase-2 (caspase-2L) but not of the short isoform (caspase-2S).

<comment>Caspase-3 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-6 (EC 3.4.22.59) and caspase-7 (EC 3.4.22.60) (5]. These caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of the majority of cellular polypeptides, (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)], which leads to the apoptotic phenotype (3,5]. Procaspase-3 can be activated by caspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36), caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61), caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.63) as well as by the serine protease granzyme B [1). Caspase-3 can activate procaspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55) (2). Activation occurs by inter-domain cleavage followed by removal of the N-terminal prodomain [6). While Asp-Glu-(Val/Ile)-Asp is thought to be the preferred cleavage sequence, the enzyme can accommodate different residues at P2 and P3 of the substrate [4). Like caspase-2, a hydrophobic residue at P5 of caspase-3 leads to more efficient hydrolysis, e.g. (Val/Leu)-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|- is a better substrate than Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|-. This is not the case for caspase-7 (4). Belongs in peptidase family C14.</comment>	<comment>Caspase-3 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-6 (EC 3.4.22.59) and caspase-7 (EC 3.4.22.60).

<comment>This enzyme is part of the family of inflammatory-caspases, which also includes caspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36) and caspase-5 (EC 3.4.22.58) in humans and caspase-11 (EC 3.4.22.64), caspase-12, caspase-13 and caspase-14 in mice. Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminal prodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation (3,5,6). The enzyme is able to cleave itself and the p30 caspase-1 precursor, but, unlike caspase-1, it is very inefficient at generating mature interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) from pro-IL-1-beta [1,4]. Both this enzyme and caspase-5 can cleave pro-caspase-3 to release the small subunit (p12) but not the large subunit (p17) (3). The caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO can also inhibit this enzyme, but more slowly (4).

<comment>Viruses that are members of the Norovirus genus (Caliciviridae family) are a major cause of epidemic acute viral gastroenteritis (4). The nonstructural proteins of these viruses are produced by proteolytic cleavage of a large precursor polyprotein, performed by a protease that is incorporated into the polyprotein (6). Cleavage sites are apparently defined by features based on both sequence and structure since several sites in the polyprotein fulfilling the identified sequence requirements are not cleaved (1). The presence of acidic (Asp), basic (Arg), aromatic (Tyr) or aliphatic (Leu) amino acids at the P1' position results in only minor differences in cleavage efficiency, suggesting that steric or conformational constraints may play a role in determining specificity (1). Changes to the amino acid at the P2 position do not alter cleavage efficiency (1,2).

<comment>Many species of bacteria carry pili on their cell surfaces. These are virulence determinants in pathogenic strains, and are assembled biosynthetically from type IV prepilin subunits. Before assembly, the prepilin molecules require proteolytic processing, which is done by the prepilin peptidase. Prepilin peptidase and its homologs play a central role not only in type IV pilus biogenesis but also in transport of macromolecules across cell membranes. Although both peptide-bond hydrolysis and N-methylation are catalyzed by the same molecule, the methylation can be inhibited without affecting peptidase activity, and it is believed that the enzyme has two separate catalytic sites.

<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing. Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which, in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes. Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeutic advantage in avoiding bacterial infection as they could prevent AHL-signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensing bacteria. This quorum-quenching enzyme removes the fatty-acid side chain from the homoserine lactone ring of AHL-dependent quorum-sensing signal molecules (1). It has broad specificity for AHLs with side changes ranging in length from 11 to 14 carbons. Substituents at the 3'-position, as found in N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, do not affect this activity (1).</comment>	<comment>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.

Large enzymes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria with a membrane sector (F(o), V(o), A(o)) and a cytoplasmic-compartment sector (F(1), V(1), A(1)). The F-type enzymes of the inner mitochondrial and thylakoid membranes act as ATP synthases. All of the enzymes included here operate in a rotational mode, where the extramembrane sector (containing 3 alpha- and 3 beta-subunits) is connected via the delta-subunit to the membrane sector by several smaller subunits. Within this complex, the gamma- and epsilon-subunits, as well as the 9-12 c subunits rotate by consecutive 120degree angles and perform parts of ATP synthesis. This movement is driven by the H(+)electrochemical potential gradient.

<comment>Two types of malonate decarboxylase are currently known, both of which form multienzyme complexes. This enzyme is a cytosolic protein that is biotin-independent. The other type is a biotin-dependent, Na(+)-translocating enzyme that includes both soluble and membrane-bound components (cf. EC 4.1.1.89, biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase). As free malonate is chemically rather inert, it has to be activated prior to decarboxylation. In both enzymes, this is achieved by exchanging malonate with an acetyl group bound to an acyl-carrier protiein (ACP), to form malonyl-ACP and acetate, with subsequent decarboxylation regenerating the acetyl-ACP. The ACP subunit of both enzymes differs from that found in fatty-acid biosynthesis by having phosphopantethine attached to a serine side-chain as 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA rather than as phosphopantetheine 4'-phosphate. The individual enzymes involved in carrying out the reaction of this enzyme complex are EC 2.3.1.187 (acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase), EC 2.3.1.39 ([acyl-carrier-protein] S-malonyltransferase) and EC 4.1.1.87 (malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase).

<comment>A flavoprotein (FAD). The overall repair reaction consists of two distinct steps, one of which is light-independent and the other one light-dependent. In the initial light-independent step, a 6-iminium ion is thought to be generated via proton transfer induced by two histidines highly conserved among the (6-4) photolyases. This intermediate spontaneously rearranges to form an oxetane intermediate by intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In the subsequent light-driven reaction, one electron is believed to be transferred from the fully reduced FAD cofactor (FADH(-)) to the oxetane intermediate thus forming a neutral FADH radical and an anionic oxetane radical, which spontaneously fractures. The excess electron is then back-transferred to the flavin radical restoring the fully reduced flavin cofactor and a pair of pyrimidine bases (2).</comment>	<comment>The overall repair reaction consists of two distinct steps, one of which is light-independent and the other one light-dependent.

<comment>The enzyme catalyzes the asymmetric condensation and cyclization of two 5-aminolevulinate molecules, which is the first common step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole pigments such as porphyrin, chlorophyll, vitamin B12, siroheme, phycobilin, and cofactor F430. The enzyme is widespread, being essential in organisms that carry out respiration, photosynthesis, or methanogenesis. The enzymes from most organisms utilize metal ions (Zn(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), and Na(+)) as cofactors that reside at multiple sites, including the active site and allosteric sites. Enzymes from archaea, yeast, and metazoa (including human) contain Zn(2+) at the active site. In humans, the enzyme is a primary target for the environmental toxin Pb. The enzymes from some organisms utilize a dynamic equilibrium between architecturally distinct multimeric assemblies as a means for allosteric regulation.</comment>	<comment>The enzyme catalyzes the asymmetric condensation and cyclization of two 5-aminolevulinate molecules, which is the first common step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole pigments such as porphyrin, chlorophyll, vitamin B12, siroheme, phycobilin, and cofactor F430.

<comment>The reaction is effectively irreversible, favoring oxopropanoate (malonic semialdehyde) and its tautomers. Also acts on 3-butynoate forming acetoacetate. The mechanism appears to involve hydration of the acetylene to 3-hydroxypropenoate, which will spontaneously tautomerize to 3-oxopropanoate. It is thus analogous to EC 4.1.1.78, acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase, in its mechanism.</comment>	<comment>The reaction is effectively irreversible, favoring oxopropanoate (malonic semialdehyde) and its tautomers.

<comment>This enzyme is responsible for the dehydration step of the dissociated (type II) fatty-acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria. The enzyme uses fatty acyl thioesters of ACP in vivo. Different forms of the enzyme may have preferences for substrates with different chain length. For example, the activity of FabZ, the ubiquitous enzyme in bacteria, decreases with increasing chain length. Gram-negative bacteria that produce unsaturated fatty acids, such as Escherichia coli, have another form (FabA) that prefers intermediate chain length, and also catalyzes EC 5.3.3.14, trans-2-decenoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] isomerase. Despite the differences both forms can catalyze all steps leading to the synthesis of palmitate (C16:0). FabZ, but not FabA, can also accept unsaturated substrates (4).</comment>	<comment>This enzyme is responsible for the dehydration step of the dissociated (type II) fatty-acid biosynthesis system that occurs in plants and bacteria.

<comment>Most mesophilic bacteria have a multimeric tryptophan synthase complex (EC 4.2.1.20) that forms L-tryptophan from L-serine and 1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate via an indole intermediate. This intermediate, which is formed by the alpha subunits, is transferred in an internal tunnel to the beta units, which convert it to tryptophan. In thermophilic organisms the high temperature enhances diffusion and causes the loss of indole. This enzyme, which does not combine with the alpha unit to form a complex, salvages the lost indole back to L-tryptophan. It has a much lower Km for indole than the beta subunit of EC 4.2.1.20.</comment>

<comment>This enzyme is a type II chelatase, being either a monomer (CbiX) or a homodimer (CibK) and being ATP-independent.

<comment>This enzyme catalyzes the third of three steps leading to the formation of siroheme from uroporphyrinogen III.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the last two steps are carried out by a single bifunctional enzyme, Met8p. In some bacteria, steps 1-3 are catalyzed by a single multifunctional protein called CysG, whereas in Bacillus megaterium, three separate enzymes carry out each of the steps, with SirB being responsible for the above reaction.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme catalyzes the third of three steps leading to the formation of siroheme from uroporphyrinogen III.

<comment>The enzyme from Bacillus sp. OxB-1 contains protoheme IX, the iron of which must be in the form iron(II) for activity.

<comment>This enzyme, along with N-carbamoylase (EC 3.5.1.77 and EC 3.5.1.87) and hydantoinase, forms part of the reaction cascade known as the "hydantoinase process", which allows the total conversion of D,L-5-monosubstituted hydantoins into optically pure D- or L-amino acids (7).

<comment>When this enzyme acts on tRNA(Asp), it catalyzes the same reaction as EC 6.1.1.12, aspartate--tRNA ligase. It has, however, diminished discrimination, so that it can also form aspartyl-tRNA(Asn).

This accounts for the ability of this enzyme in, for example, Thermus thermophilus, to recognize both tRNA(Asp) (GUC anticodon) and tRNA(Asn) (GUU anticodon).

<comment>The enzyme from Bacillus sp. requires Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for activity. While the enzyme has extremely broad substrate specificity, it does not accept highly charged amino acids, such as Lys, Arg, Glu and Asp, nor does it react with secondary amines such as Pro. The N-terminal residue of the alpha-dipeptide formed seems to be limited to Ala, Gly, Ser, Thr and Met (with Ala and Ser being the most preferred), whereas the C-terminal residue seems to allow for a wider variety of amino acids (but with a preference for Met and Phe). However, not all combinations or dipeptides are formed. For example, while Ser is acceptable for the N-terminus and Thr for the C-terminus, a Ser-Thr dipeptide is not formed. D-Ala, D-Ser and D-Phe are not substrates. Belongs in the ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine/thiol ligase superfamily.</comment>	<comment>While the enzyme has extremely broad substrate specificity, it does not accept highly charged amino acids, such as Lys, Arg, Glu and Asp, nor does it react with secondary amines such as Pro.

<comment>The conversion of (R)-pantoate to (R)-4'-phosphopantothenate is part of the pathway leading to biosynthesis of 4'-phosphopantetheine, an essential cofactor of coenzyme A and acyl-carrier protein.

<comment>The enzyme from Escherichia coli has two active sites (4) that are connected by an intramolecular ammonia tunnel (6,7). The enzyme catalyzes three distinct chemical reactions: glutamine hydrolysis to yield ammonia takes place in the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal active site mediates both the synthesis of a beta-aspartyl-AMP intermediate and its subsequent reaction with ammonia. The ammonia released is channeled to the other active site to yield asparagine (7).</comment>	<comment>The enzyme from Escherichia coli has two active sites that are connected by an intramolecular ammonia tunnel.

<comment>The product carbamoyl phosphate is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of arginine and the pyrimidine nucleotides (4). The enzyme from Escherichia coli has three separate active sites, which are connected by a molecular tunnel that is almost 100 A in length (8). The amidotransferase domain within the small subunit of the enzyme hydrolyzes glutamine to ammonia via a thioester intermediate. The ammonia migrates through the interior of the protein, where it reacts with carboxy phosphate to produce the carbamate intermediate. The carboxy-phosphate intermediate is formed by the phosphorylation of bicarbonate by ATP at a site contained within the N-terminal half of the large subunit. The carbamate intermediate is transported through the interior of the protein to a second site within the C-terminal half of the large subunit, where it is phosphorylated by another ATP to yield the final product, carbamoyl phosphate (6).</comment>	<comment>The product carbamoyl phosphate is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of arginine and the pyrimidine nucleotides.

<comment>This reaction forms part of a two-reaction system for producing asparaginyl-tRNA in Deinococcus radiodurans and other organisms lacking a specific enzyme for asparagine synthesis. In the first step, a non-discriminating ligase (EC 6.1.1.23, aspartate--tRNA(Asn) ligase) mischarges tRNA(Asn) with aspartate, leading to the formation of aspartyl-tRNA(Asn). The aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) is not used in protein synthesis until the present enzyme converts it into asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn) (aspartyl-tRNA(Asp) is not a substrate for this reaction). Ammonia or asparagine can substitute for the preferred substrate glutamine.</comment>	<comment>This reaction forms part of a two-reaction system for producing asparaginyl-tRNA in Deinococcus radiodurans and other organisms lacking a specific enzyme for asparagine synthesis.

<comment>In systems lacking discernible glutamine--tRNA ligase (EC 6.1.1.18), glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) is formed by a two-enzyme system. In the first step, a nondiscriminating ligase (EC 6.1.1.24, glutamate--tRNA(Gln) ligase) mischarges tRNA(Gln) with glutamate, forming glutamyl-tRNA(Gln).

<comment>This enzyme is the first glutamine amidotransferase that participates in the anaerobic (early cobalt insertion) biosynthetic pathway of adenosylcobalamin, and catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of cobyrinate a,c-diamide from cobyrinate using either L-glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source. It is proposed that the enzyme first catalyzes the amidation of the c-carboxylate, and then the intermediate is released into solution and binds to the same catalytic site for the amidation of the a-carboxylate. The K(m) for ammonia is substantially higher than that for L-glutamine.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme is the first glutamine amidotransferase that participates in the anaerobic (early cobalt insertion) biosynthetic pathway of adenosylcobalamin, and catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of cobyrinate a,c-diamide from cobyrinate using either L-glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source.

<comment>A biotin-containing enzyme that requires Mg(2+) for activity. It was originally thought (1) that this enzyme was a promoting factor for the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate by EC 1.1.1.41, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)), but this has since been disproved (2). The product of the reaction is unstable and is quickly converted into isocitrate by the action of EC 1.1.1.41 (2).</comment>	<comment>It was originally thought that this enzyme was a promoting factor for the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate by EC 1.1.1.41, but this has since been disproved.

<comment>This enzyme, which forms part of the aerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, is a type I chelatase, being heterotrimeric and ATP-dependent. It comprises two components, one of which corresponds to CobN and the other is composed of two polypeptides, specified by cobS and cobT in Pseudomonas denitrificans, and named CobST (1). Hydrogenobyrinic acid is a very poor substrate. ATP can be replaced by dATP or CTP but the reaction proceeds more slowly. CobN exhibits a high affinity for hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. The oligomeric protein CobST possesses at least one sulfhydryl group that is essential for ATP-binding. Once the Co(2+) is inserted, the next step in the pathway ensures that the cobalt is ligated securely by reducing Co(II) to Co(I). This step is carried out by EC 1.16.8.1, cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase.</comment>	<comment>This enzyme, which forms part of the aerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, is a type I chelatase, being heterotrimeric and ATP-dependent.
