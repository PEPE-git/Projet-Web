<COMMENTS>In the course of the reaction of EC 1.11.1.15, its cysteine residueis alternately oxidized to the sulfenic acid, S-hydroxycysteine,and reduced back to cysteine.Occasionally the S-hydroxycysteine residue is further oxidized to thesulfinic acid S-hydroxy-S-oxocysteine, thereby inactivating theenzyme.The reductase provides a mechanism for regenerating the active formof peroxiredoxin, i.e. the peroxiredoxin-(S-hydroxycysteine) form.Apparently the reductase first catalyzes the phosphorylation of the-S(O)-OH group by ATP to give -S(O)-O-P, which is attached to theperoxiredoxin by a cysteine residue, forming an -S(O)-S- link betweenthe two enzymes.Attack by a thiol splits this bond, leaving the peroxiredoxin as thesulfenic acid and the reductase as the thiol.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Brings about the chlorination of a range of organic molecules,forming stable C-Cl bonds.Also oxidizes bromide and iodide.Enzymes of this type are either heme-thiolate proteins, or containvanadate.A secreted enzyme produced by the ascomycetous fungus Caldariomycesfumago (Leptoxyphium fumago) is an example of the heme-thiolate type.It catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid by transferring oneoxygen atom from H(2)O(2) to chloride.At a separate site it catalyzes the chlorination of activatedaliphatic and aromatic substrates, via HClO and derived chlorinespecies.In the absence of halides, it shows peroxidase (e.g. phenoloxidation) and peroxygenase activities.The latter inserts oxygen from H(2)O(2) into, for example, styrene(side chain epoxidation) and toluene (benzylic hydroxylation),however, these activities are less pronounced than its activity withhalides.Has little activity with non-activated substrates such as aromaticrings, ethers or saturated alkanes.The chlorinating peroxidase produced by ascomycetous fungi (e.g.Curvularia inaequalis) is an example of a vanadium chloroperoxidase,and is related to bromide peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.18).It contains vanadate and oxidizes chloride, bromide and iodide intohypohalous acids.In the absence of halides, it peroxygenates organic sulfides andoxidizes ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid))but no phenols.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidantproteins.They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cysand 1-Cys peroxiredoxins.The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centered around a redox-active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine.All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common,in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate andis oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid).The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration ofcysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the threeperoxiredoxin classes.For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidaticS-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving'cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form anintersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of severalcell-specific thiol-containing reductants (R'-SH) (e.g. thioredoxin,AhpF, tryparedoxin or AhpD), completing the catalytic cycle.In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and itsresolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reactionforms an intrachain disulfide bond.To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to usethioredoxin as an electron donor.The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so that itsoxidized form is directly reduced to cysteine by the reductantmolecule.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme from human can transfer N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc)to N-glycan and O-glycan substrates that have N-acetyl-D-glucosamine(GlcNAc) but not D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) at their non-reducing end.The N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group is normally on a coreoligosaccharide although benzyl glycosides have been used in enzyme-characterization experiments.Some glycohormones, e.g. lutropin and thyrotropin contain theN-glycan structure containing the N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>The enzyme-catalyzed reaction is reversible.In the reverse direction to that shown above, the enzyme is specificfor alpha,alpha-trehalose as substrate, as it cannot use alpha- orbeta-paranitrophenyl glucosides, maltose, sucrose, lactose orcellobiose.While the enzymes from the thermophilic bacterium Rubrobacterxylanophilus and the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshiican use ADP-, UDP- and GDP-alpha-D-glucose to the same extent, thatfrom the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis has amarked preference for ADP-alpha-D-glucose and that from thehyperthermophilic archaeon Thermoproteus tenax has a markedpreference for UDP-alpha-D-glucose.Formerly EC 2.4.1.n1.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>In Salmonella typhimurium LT2, under anaerobic conditions, CobU(EC 2.7.7.62 and EC 2.7.1.156), CobT (EC 2.4.2.21),CobC (EC 3.1.3.73) and CobS (EC 2.7.8.26) catalyze reactions in thenucleotide loop assembly pathway, which convert adenosylcobinamide(AdoCbi) into adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl).CobT and CobC are involved in 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole activationwhereby 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is converted to its riboside,alpha-ribazole.The second branch of the nucleotide loop assembly pathway is thecobinamide (Cbi) activation branch where AdoCbi oradenosylcobinamide-phosphate is converted to the activatedintermediate AdoCbi-GDP by CobU.The final step in adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis is the condensationof AdoCbi-GDP with alpha-ribazole, which is catalyzed by CobS(EC 2.7.8.26), to yield adenosylcobalamin.CobU is a bifunctional enzyme that has both kinase (EC 2.7.1.156) andguanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62) activities.However, both activities are not required at all times.The kinase activity has been proposed to function only whenS.typhimurium is assimilating cobinamide whereas theguanylyltransferase activity is required for both assimilation ofexogenous cobinamide and for de novo synthesis of adenosylcobalamin.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme from Chlorella shows very little activity towardmonothiols such as glutathione and cysteine (cf. EC 2.8.1.3).The enzyme probably transfers the sulfur atom onto one thiol group toform -S-S(-), and sulfide is spontaneously expelled from this byreaction with the other thiol group.May be identical with EC 2.8.1.1.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>The enzyme binds a [4Fe-4S] and a [2Fe-2S] cluster.In every reaction cycle, the enzyme consumes two molecules of AdoMet,each producing 5'-deoxyadenosine and a putative dethiobiotinyl carbonradical.Reaction with another equivalent of AdoMet results in abstraction ofthe C6 methylene pro-(S) hydrogen atom from 9-mercaptodethiobiotin,and the resulting carbon radical is quenched via formation of anintramolecular C-S bond, thus closing the biotin thiophane ring.The sulfur donor (S) is believed to be the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which issacrificed in the process, so that in vitro the reaction is a singleturnover.In vivo, the [2Fe-2S] cluster can be reassembled by the Isc or Sufiron-sulfur cluster assembly systems, to allow further catalysis.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>The sulfur from free L-cysteine is first transferred to a cysteineresidue in the active site, and then passed on to various otheracceptors.The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters,thio-nucleosides in tRNA, thiamine, biotin, lipoate and pyranopterin(molybdopterin).In Azotobacter vinelandii, this sulfur provides the inorganic sulfiderequired for nitrogenous metallocluster formation.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>This enzyme sulfates the residues marked with an asterisk insequences containing at least ->IdoA2S->GlcN*-> or ->GlcA2S->GlcN*->.Preference for GlcN2S versus unmodified GlcN has not yet beenestablished.Additional structural features are presumably required for substraterecognition, since the 3-O-sulfated residue is of low abundance,whereas the above IdoA-containing sequence is quite abundant.This enzyme differs from the other [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine3-sulfotransferases by modifying selected glucosamine residuespreceded by GlcA2S; EC 2.8.2.23 prefers GlcA or IdoA, whereasEC 2.8.2.30 prefers IdoA2S.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterialspecies and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulencegenes in a process known as quorum-sensing.Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the populationdensity reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which,in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeuticadvantage in avoiding bacterial infection as they could prevent AHL-signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensingbacteria.N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone andN-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone can act as substrates.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme from Thalassomonas sp. can use agarose, agarohexaose andneoagarohexaose as substrate.The products of agarohexaose hydrolysis are dimers and tetramers,with agarotetraose being the predominant product, whereas hydrolysisof neoagarohexaose gives rise to two types of trimer.While the enzyme can also hydrolyze the highly sulfated agaroseporphyran very efficiently, it cannot hydrolyze kappa-carrageenan andiota-carrageenan.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>When neoagarohexaose is used as a substrate, the oligosaccharide iscleaved at the non-reducing end to produce 3,6-anhydro-L-galactoseand agaropentaose, which is further hydrolyzed to agarobiose andagarotriose.With neoagarotetraose as substrate, the products are predominantlyagarotriose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose.In Vibrio sp. the actions of EC 3.2.1.81 and EC 3.2.1.159 can be usedto degrade agarose to 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and D-galactose.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of a terminal, unsubstituted xylosideat the extreme reducing end of a xylogluco-oligosaccharide.Representative alpha-xylosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 31utilize a two-step (double-displacement) mechanism involving acovalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, and retain the anomericconfiguration of the product.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>The backbone of porphyran consists largely (approximately 70%) of(1->3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranose followed by (1->4)-linked alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate (the other 30% are mostly agarobioserepeating units of (1->3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranose followed by(1->4)-linked 3,6-anhydro-alpha-L-galactopyranose).This enzyme cleaves the (1->4) linkages between beta-D-galactopyranose and alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate, forming mostlythe disaccharide alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate-(1->3)-beta-D-galactose, although some longer oligosaccharides of even number ofresidues are also observed.Since the enzyme is inactive on the non-sulfated agarose portion ofthe porphyran backbone, some agarose fragments are also included inthe products.Methylation of the D-galactose prevents its binding at position -1.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>In the equine arterivirus (EAV), the replicase gene is translatedinto open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1ab polyproteins.This enzyme is the main viral proteinase and processes five cleavagesites in the ORF1a protein and three in the ORF1b-encoded part of theORF1ab protein to yield nonstructural proteins (nsp5-nsp12).It combines the catalytic system of a chymotrypsin-like serinepeptidase (His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad) with the substratespecificity of a 3C-like serine peptidase (Glu or Gln) at the P1position and a small amino-acid residue (Gly, Ser or Ala) at the P1'position.Cleavage of ORF1ab by this enzyme is essential for viral replication.Belongs to peptidase family S32.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a birnavirus thatcauses an acute, contagious disease in young salmonid fish.As with most viruses that infect eukaryotic cells, the proteolyticprocessing of viral precursor proteins is a crucial step in the lifecycle of this virus.pVP2 is converted into VP2 by cleavage near the carboxy end of pVP2;this cleavage is most likely due to host-cell proteases rather thanVP4.Differs from most serine peptidases in not having the catalytic triadSer-His-Asp.Belongs to peptidase family S50.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>This enzyme plays a central role in a regulatory checkpoint (thesigma(K) checkpoint), which coordinates gene expression during thelater stages of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis.The enzyme activates proteolytic processing of a sporulation-specificsigma factor, pro-sigma(K), to its mature and active form, sigma(K),by self-cleavage.The enzyme is also subject to secondary proteolysis, which presumablyinactivates SpoIVB.The enzyme is also essential for the formation of heat-resistantspores.Belongs to peptidase family S55.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Specific for prorenin from the mouse submandibular gland, as proreninfrom the mouse kidney (Ren1) and human prorenin are not substrates.Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the enzyme willalso cleave prorenin when Lys-Arg is replaced by Arg-Arg or Gln-Argbut the rate of reaction is much slower when Lys-Lys is used.Also able to process pro-interleukin-1-beta (pro-IL-1-beta) in mousesubmandibular gland to form IL-1-beta.Belongs to peptidase family S1A.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>The egg envelope of Xenopus laevis is modified during transit of theegg through the pars rectus oviduct, changing the egg envelope froman unfertilizable form to a fertilizable form.This process involves the conversion of glycoprotein gp43 to gp41(ZPC) by the pars recta protease oviductin.It is thought that the enzymatically active protease moleculecomprises the N-terminal protease domain coupled to two C-terminalCUB domains, which are related to the mammalian spermadhesinmolecules implicated in mediating sperm-envelope interactions.Also found in Bufo japonicus.Belongs to peptidase family S1.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Caspase-2 is an initiator caspase, as are caspases-8 (EC 3.4.22.61),caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.63).Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminalprodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation.Two forms of caspase-2 exist that have antagonistic effects: caspase-2L induces programd cell death and caspase-2S suppresses cell death.Caspase-2 is activated by caspase-3 (EC 3.4.22.56), or by a caspase-3-like protease.Activation involves cleavage of the N-terminal prodomain, followed byself-proteolysis between the large and small subunits of pro-caspase-2 and further proteolysis into smaller fragments.Proteolysis occurs at Asp residues and the preferred substrate forthis enzyme is a pentapeptide rather than a tetrapeptide.Apart from itself, the enzyme can cleave golgin-16, which is presentin the Golgi complex and has a cleavage site that is unique forcaspase-2.alpha-II-spectrin, a component of the membrane cytoskeleton, is asubstrate of the large isoform of pro-caspase-2 (caspase-2L) but notof the short isoform (caspase-2S).Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Caspase-3 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-6(EC 3.4.22.59) and caspase-7 (EC 3.4.22.60).These caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of the majority ofcellular polypeptides, (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)),which leads to the apoptotic phenotype.Procaspase-3 can be activated by caspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36), caspase-8(EC 3.4.22.61), caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10(EC 3.4.22.63) as well as by the serine protease granzyme B.Caspase-3 can activate procaspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55).Activation occurs by inter-domain cleavage followed by removal of theN-terminal prodomain.While Asp-Glu-(Val/Ile)-Asp is thought to be the preferred cleavagesequence, the enzyme can accommodate different residues at P2 and P3of the substrate.Like caspase-2, a hydrophobic residue at P5 of caspase-3 leads tomore efficient hydrolysis, e.g. (Val/Leu)-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|- is abetter substrate than Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|-.This is not the case for caspase-7.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Part of the family of inflammatory-caspases, which also includescaspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36) and caspase-5 (EC 3.4.22.58) in humans andcaspase-11 (EC 3.4.22.64), caspase-12, caspase-13 and caspase-14 inmice.Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminalprodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation.Able to cleave itself and the p30 caspase-1 precursor, but, unlikecaspase-1, it is very inefficient at generating mature interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) from pro-IL-1-beta.Both this enzyme and caspase-5 can cleave pro-caspase-3 to releasethe small subunit (p12) but not the large subunit (p17).The caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO can also inhibit thisenzyme, but more slowly.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Caspase-6 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-3(EC 3.4.22.56) and caspase-7 (EC 3.4.22.60).These caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of the majority ofcellular polypeptides, (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)),which lead to the apoptotic phenotype.Caspase-6 can cleave its prodomain to produce mature caspase-6, whichdirectly activates caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61) and leads to cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria; the release of cytochrome c, which isan essential component of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.Can also cleave and inactivate lamins, the intermediate filamentscaffold proteins of the nuclear envelope, leading to nuclearfragementation in the final phases of apoptosis.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Caspase-7 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-3(EC 3.4.22.56) and caspase-6 (EC 3.4.22.59).These caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of the majority ofcellular polypeptides, (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)),which lead to the apoptotic phenotype.Although a hydrophobic residue at P5 of caspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55) andcaspase-3 leads to more efficient hydrolysis, the amino-acid residueat this location in caspase-7 has no effect.Caspase-7 is activated by the initiator caspases (caspase-8(EC 3.4.22.61), caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10(EC 3.4.22.63)).Removal of the N-terminal prodomain occurs before cleavage in thelinker region between the large and small subunits.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase, as are caspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55),caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61) and caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.63).Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminalprodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation.An alternatively spliced version of caspase-9 also exists, caspase-9S, that inhibits apoptosis, similar to the situation found withcaspase-2.Phosphorylation of caspase-9 from some species by Akt, a serine-threonine protein kinase, inhibits caspase activity in vitro andcaspase activation in vivo.The activity of caspase-9 is increased dramatically upon associationwith the apoptosome but the enzyme can be activated withoutproteolytic cleavage.Procaspase-3 is the enzyme's physiological substrate.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Caspase-10 is an initiator caspase, as are caspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55),caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61) and caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62).Like caspase-8, it contains two tandem death effector domains (DEDs)in its N-terminal prodomain, which play a role in procaspaseactivation.Has many overlapping substrates in common with caspase-8, such as RIP(the cleavage of which impairs NF-kappa-B survival signaling andstarts the cell-death process) and PAK2 (associated with some of themorphological features of apoptosis, such as cell rounding andapoptotic body formation).Bid, a Bcl2 protein, can be cleaved by caspase-3 (EC 3.4.22.56),caspase-8 and caspase-10 at Lys-Gln-Thr-Asp-|- to yield the pro-apoptotic p15 fragment.The p15 fragment is N-myristoylated and enhances cytochrome c releasefrom mitochondria (which initiatiates the intrinsic apoptosispathway).Bid can be further cleaved by caspase-10 and granzyme B but not bycaspase-3 and caspase-8 at Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-|- to yield a p13 fragmentthat is not N-myristoylated.Belongs to peptidase family C14.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>This enzyme, derived from the house dust mite, is a major componentof the allergic immune response.The substrate specificity of this enzyme is not altogether clear; itcleaves the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23 at 298-Glu-|-Ser-299 and155-Ser-|-Ser-156.It also cleaves the pulmonary structural proteins occludin andclaudin at Leu-|-Leu, Asp-|-Leu and at Gly-|-Thr bonds, and it canalso cleave the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor(CD25).Using a positional scanning combinatorial library, it was found thatthe major substrate-specificity determinant is for Ala in the P2position.The enzyme shows only a slight preference for basic amino acids inthe P1 and P3 positions and a preference for aliphatic amino acidssuch as Ile, Pro, Val, Leu and norleucine in the P4 position.Belongs to peptidase family C1.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>Viruses that are members of the Norovirus genus (Caliciviridaefamily) are a major cause of epidemic acute viral gastroenteritis.The nonstructural proteins of these viruses are produced byproteolytic cleavage of a large precursor polyprotein, performed by aprotease that is incorporated into the polyprotein.Cleavage sites are apparently defined by features based on bothsequence and structure since several sites in the polyproteinfulfilling the identified sequence requirements are not cleaved.The presence of acidic (Asp), basic (Arg), aromatic (Tyr) oraliphatic (Leu) amino acids at the P1' position results in only minordifferences in cleavage efficiency, suggesting that steric orconformational constraints may play a role in determiningspecificity.Changes to the amino acid at the P2 position do not alter cleavageefficiency.Belongs to peptidase family C37.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterialspecies and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulencegenes in a process known as quorum-sensing.Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the populationdensity reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which,in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeuticadvantage in avoiding bacterial infection as they could prevent AHL-signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensingbacteria.This quorum-quenching enzyme removes the fatty-acid side chain fromthe homoserine lactone ring of AHL-dependent quorum-sensing signalmolecules.It has broad specificity for AHLs with side changes ranging in lengthfrom 11 to 14 carbons.Substituents at the 3'-position, as found in N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, do not affect this activity.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>Two types of malonate decarboxylase are currently known, both ofwhich form multienzyme complexes.This enzyme is a cytosolic protein that is biotin-independent.The other type is a biotin-dependent, Na(+)-translocating enzyme thatincludes both soluble and membrane-bound components (cf.EC 4.1.1.89).As free malonate is chemically rather inert, it has to be activatedprior to decarboxylation.In both enzymes, this is achieved by exchanging malonate with anacetyl group bound to an acyl-carrier protiein (ACP), to formmalonyl-ACP and acetate, with subsequent decarboxylation regeneratingthe acetyl-ACP.The ACP subunit of both enzymes differs from that found in fatty-acidbiosynthesis by having phosphopantethine attached to a serine side-chain as 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA rather than asphosphopantetheine 4'-phosphate.The individual enzymes involved in carrying out the reaction of thisenzyme complex are EC 2.3.1.187, EC 2.3.1.39 and EC 4.1.1.87.The carboxy group is lost with retention of configuration.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The overall repair reaction consists of two distinct steps, one ofwhich is light-independent and the other one light-dependent.In the initial light-independent step, a 6-iminium ion is thought tobe generated via proton transfer induced by two histidines highlyconserved among the (6-4) photolyases.This intermediate spontaneously rearranges to form an oxetaneintermediate by intramolecular nucleophilic attack.In the subsequent light-driven reaction, one electron is believed tobe transferred from the fully reduced FAD cofactor (FADH(-)) to theoxetane intermediate thus forming a neutral FADH radical and ananionic oxetane radical, which spontaneously fractures.The excess electron is then back-transferred to the flavin radicalrestoring the fully reduced flavin cofactor and a pair of pyrimidinebases.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme catalyzes an early step in the biosynthesis of themolybdenum cofactor (MoCo).The enzyme MoaA from bacteria and the human enzyme MOCS1A eachcontain two oxygen-sensitive FeS clusters.The enzyme is a member of the superfamily of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent radical (radical AdoMet) enzymes.In bacteria, the reaction is catalyzed by MoaA and requires theaction of MoaC.The latter protein is equivalent to the C-terminal domain of theeukaryotic enzyme MOCS1A which does not need further proteincomponents to perform the reaction.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The alpha-subunit catalyzes the conversion of 1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate to indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate(this reaction was listed formerly as EC 4.1.2.8).The indole migrates to the beta-subunit where, in the presence ofpyridoxal 5'-phosphate, it is combined with L-serine to formL-tryptophan.In some organisms this enzyme is part of a multifunctional proteinthat also includes one or more of the enzymes EC 2.4.2.18,EC 4.1.1.48, EC 4.1.3.27 and EC 5.3.1.24.In thermophilic organisms, where the high temperature enhancesdiffusion and causes the loss of indole, a protein similar to thebeta subunit can be found (EC 4.2.1.122).That enzyme cannot combine with the alpha unit of EC 4.2.1.20 to forma complex.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>This enzyme is a type II chelatase, being either a monomer (CbiX) ora homodimer (CibK) and being ATP-independent.CbiK from Salmonella enterica uses precorrin-2 as the substrate toyield cobalt-precorrin-2.The enzyme contains two histidines at the active site that arethought to be involved in the deprotonation of the tetrapyrrolesubstrate as well as in metal binding.CbiX from Bacillus megaterium inserts cobalt at the level ofsirohydrochlorin (factor-II) rather than precorrin-2.</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>This enzyme catalyzes the third of three steps leading to theformation of siroheme from uroporphyrinogen III.The first step involves the donation of two S-adenosyl-L-methionine-derived methyl groups to carbons 2 and 7 of uroporphyrinogen III toform precorrin-2 (EC 2.1.1.107) and the second step involves anNAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenation to form sirohydrochlorin fromprecorrin-2 (EC 1.3.1.76).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the last two steps are carried out by asingle bifunctional enzyme, Met8p.In some bacteria, steps 1-3 are catalyzed by a single multifunctionalprotein called CysG, whereas in Bacillus megaterium, three separateenzymes carry out each of the steps, with SirB being responsible forthe above reaction.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The enzyme from Bacillus sp. OxB-1 contains protoheme IX, the iron ofwhich must be in the form Fe(2+) for activity.(Z)-phenylacetaldoxime binds to ferric heme (the Fe(3+) form) via theoxygen atom whereas it binds to the active ferrous form via thenitrogen atom.In this way, the oxidation state of the heme controls thecoordination stucture of the substrate--heme complex, which regulatesenzyme activity.The enzyme is active toward several (Z)-arylacetaldoximes and (E/Z)-alkylaldoximes as well as toward arylalkylaldoximes such as3-phenylpropionaldoxime and 4-phenylbutyraldoxime.However, it is inactive with phenylacetaldoximes that have asubstituent group at an alpha-site of an oxime group, for example,with (E/Z)-2-phenylpropionaldoxime and (E/Z)-mandelaldoxime.The activity of the enzyme is inhibited completely by the heavy-metalcations Cu(+), Cu(2+), Ag(+) and Hg(+) whereas Fe(2+) and Sn(2+) havean activatory effect.</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>When this enzyme acts on tRNA(Asp), it catalyzes the same reaction asEC 6.1.1.12.It has, however, diminished discrimination, so that it can also formaspartyl-tRNA(Asn).This relaxation of specificity has been found to result from theabsence of a loop in the tRNA that specifically recognizes the thirdposition of the anticodon.This accounts for the ability of this enzyme in, for example, Thermusthermophilus, to recognize both tRNA(Asp) (GUC anticodon) andtRNA(Asn) (GUU anticodon).The aspartate-tRNA(Asn) is not used in protein synthesis until it isconverted by EC 6.3.5.6 into asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn).</COMMENTS>
<COMMENTS>When this enzyme acts on tRNA(Glu), it catalyzes the same reaction asEC 6.1.1.17.It has, however, diminished discrimination, so that it can also formglutamate-tRNA(Gln).This relaxation of specificity has been found to result from theabsence of a loop in the tRNA that specifically recognizes the thirdposition of the anticodon.This accounts for the ability of this enzyme in, for example,Bacillus subtilis, to recognize both tRNA(1)(Gln) (UUG anticodon) andtRNA(Glu) (UUC anticodon) but not tRNA(2)(Gln) (CUG anticodon).The ability of this enzyme to recognize both tRNA(Glu) and one of thetRNA(Gln) isoacceptors derives from their sharing a major identityelement, a hypermodified derivative of U34 (5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine).The glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) is not used in protein synthesis until it isconverted by EC 6.3.5.7 into glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln).</COMMENTS>

<COMMENTS>The product carbamoyl phosphate is an intermediate in thebiosynthesis of arginine and the pyrimidine nucleotides.The enzyme from Escherichia coli has three separate active sites,which are connected by a molecular tunnel that is almost 100 A inlength.The amidotransferase domain within the small subunit of the enzymehydrolyzes glutamine to ammonia via a thioester intermediate.The ammonia migrates through the interior of the protein, where itreacts with carboxy phosphate to produce the carbamate intermediate.The carboxy-phosphate intermediate is formed by the phosphorylationof bicarbonate by ATP at a site contained within the N-terminal halfof the large subunit.The carbamate intermediate is transported through the interior of theprotein to a second site within the C-terminal half of the largesubunit, where it is phosphorylated by another ATP to yield the finalproduct, carbamoyl phosphate.Formerly EC 2.7.2.9.</COMMENTS>
